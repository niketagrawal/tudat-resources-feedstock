build:
  # A non-negative integer representing the build number of the package.
  #  Unlike the build string, the build_number is inspected by conda.
  #  Conda uses it to sort packages that have otherwise identical names
  #  and versions to determine the latest one. This is important because
  #  new builds that contain bug fixes for the way a package is built may be
  #  added to a repository.
  number: 4   # [win]
  number: 3   # [not win]
